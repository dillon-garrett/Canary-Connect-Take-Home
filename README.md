# Canary-Connect-Take-Home

This was a fun project to work on. I'm looking forward to discussing it in greater detail.

## Getting Started

To run on your local machine, simply fork and clone this repo. Once cloned, install the necessary dependencies either by:

```npm i```
or
```yarn```

## Running Scripts

To run the application in the dev environment type the following in the terminal:
```npm run start```

To build the application for production:
```npm run build```

To run tests:
```npm run test```

## Using the Application
While in developement environment, navigate to ```localhost:1234``` to access the application.

To interact with the app, simply choose the type of graph you want to display and click __submit__. If you would like to close the graph, you may do so by clicking __hide graph__.

*\*A quick note:* perhaps it is my computer/internet connection, but the API is sometimes quite slow. To prevent this I would have implemented caching, but I would have needed direct access to the origin server. Had I had more time, there are a number of practices I would have implemented or implemented more effectively. I look forward to discussing these.
